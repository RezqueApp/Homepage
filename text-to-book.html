            <h2 class="text-center">SMS Marketing VS Advertising</h2>
            <br>

            <p>People are inundated with emails and gone are the days of 90% open rates. Or are they?</p>

            <p>Text messaging still boasts a 90% open rate and the few saavy businesses that are utilizing them well are getting mutliples on their ROI. Compared to marketing channels like facebook and adwords where the cost of attention has gotten a lot more expensive than they used to be, utlilizing SMS marketing is becoming a more reliable investment to boost revenue.</p>

            <p>Compare the cost of sending an SMS at a few cents per message to a few dollars per click. With conversions rates as high as 20-40% via SMS and 1-2% from ads, you can see why business are turning their attention to SMS Marketing.</p>

            <h3>Why aren't more businesses doing SMS marketing?</h3>

            <p>The reason why SMS marketing is so effective is that there is regulation around using SMS for marketing purposes. In the US, businesses are required to get their customers to opt-in to receive promotions. However, sending notifications like reminders along with transactional information like order details is ok.</p>

            <p>Another reason a lot of businesses don't use SMS is because it costs money. A few cents per SMS doesn't sound like much but after a few thousand messages, it adds up.</p>

            <h3>How do I navigate text messaging regulations?</h3>

            <p>The easiest way to implement a strategy is to partner up with an agency that has some experience in setting up SMS marketing campaigns.</p>

            <p>Another option is to just start using SMS for notifications so that your customers get comfortable with messages being sent by your company. The reality is that if your customer list is within the range of a few thousand as most small businesses are, you can manage any issues your customers might have with you sending them messages without their consent.</p>

            <p>However, it's best to just ask your customers if they would like promotions sent to them. And if you send them messages sparingly and only on the most important promotions, you'll likely have a happy customer and a thriving business.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-center">SMS Best Practices</h2>
            <br>

            <p>The limitations of SMS is a double edged sword. You only have so many characters to share your message but that limitation can actually be a knock-out punch if crafted carefully. The cost of sending SMS combined with the character limitations forces us to carefully manage who we send out messages to, when we send our messages, and what we say in our messages.</p>

            <h3>Who to send SMS marketing messages to</h3>

            <p>It's best to segment our lists either into random chunks or based on a few criteria like the last time your customers visited or made a purchase, how much they spent, or demographic information. The criteria is going to depend on the purpose of your marketing campaign.</p>

            <p>For example, if you have a list of a couple thousand customers and after getting a few cancellations for a spa treatment, you want to fill those slots, you could break that customer list into chunks of 100 and offer them a 30% discount. That way if only a few of those customers convert, you fill you slots and you get to save the remaining list for other days when you want to fill available slots so as not to bombard your entire customer list.</p>

            <h3>When to send SMS marketing messages</h3>

            <p>Notifications can be annoying and pervasive. That's why it's best to send messages during normal business hours. People expect to hear about non-personal matters throughout the day during normal business hours so they'll be more receptive to your messages if you schedule your messages accordingly.</p>

            <h3>What to say in SMS marketing messages</h3>

            <p>Keep it short and sweet. And if you can't add a link with additional details.</p>

            <p>An example of a promotional offer might look something like this:</p>

            <div class="card">Hi Rebecca, we're offering 50% off for a full body massage this week only! Reply 1 to see available dates.</div>

            <br>
            <h2 class="text-center">SMS Marketing Automation</h2>
            <br>

            <p>You can do a lot with SMS Marketing. By setting up highly targeted campaigns to customers that haven't heard from you (or is simply ignoring your emails along with all the other promotional emails they get in their inbox) you can grow your business and consistently deliver value to your customers so they rave about your services to their friends and family.</p>

            <h3>Automate your reviews with text messages</h3>

            <p>You can set up templates and pull appointment details from your calendar and automate requests for a review from all of your customers. Here's a <a href="/business-review-automation">more detailed guide to getting good reviews with text message automation.</a></p>

            <h3>Send appointment reminders with text messages</h3>

            <p>Appointment reminders is a no-brainer these days. Everyone is busier than ever and we have so many apps that are competing for our attention. And our customers don't care if they booked an appointment with us unless we show them that we care. By sending a regular interval of email and SMS reminders, your customer will not only show up for their appoitnment, but they'll also thank you for the reminders. It's a value added service and your customers will remember that the next time they need the same service.</p>

            <h3>Send order notifications</h3>

            <p>If you run an online shop and process orders. You can keep your customers abreast about order details with SMS notifications. These days, with the likes of Amazon offering same day delivery services, the best we can do is to keep our customers up to speed with what is going on with their order. Otherwise, your business is subject to fall to the wayside of your customer's list of favorite stores to shop at.</p>

            <p>If you're not providing additional services through your ordering process by notifying your customers that you're on top of things, they may think your products aren't worth the money. Your product is not only the physical product but the entire purchasing process from discovery to delivery and follow-up. So make your products more valuable by keeping your customers up to date on their order status.</p>

            <h3>Send delivery notifications</h3>

            <p>Package thefts abound and return fraud running rampant, the best solution is sending a webhook to your SMS provider when a package is updated as being delivered by your package delivery partner. By doing so, you give your customers a heads up that they should be on the look out for a package and they can forward the message to their neighbors to hold your package for them. This simple automation could save you lots of money in customer service time and lost package dispute costs.</p>
